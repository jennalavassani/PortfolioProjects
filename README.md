In this SQL project, I explore customer acquisition data that I downloaded from Kaggle to uncover important marketing insights. This project combines my technical skills in SQL with PostgreSQL 16. This kind of analysis is ideal for organizations seeking to enhance their customer acquisition strategies.

I explore the following:

- Quick glance at overall metrics.
- Which marketing channels work best.
- Spotlighting the biggest revenue generators.
- Estimating long-term value (CLV).
- Understanding profitability per channel.
- Exploring the relationship of Cost vs. Revenue.
- Segmentation by Conversion Rate to customize marketing strategies.
